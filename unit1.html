            <p>1.1 - IT are playing a crucial role in data processing and decision making. Its role is to support the key aspects of running an organization, such as communication, record-keeping, decision making, data analysis and more. Companies use this information to improve their business operations, make strategic decisions and gain a competitive edge.</p>
            <p>1.2 - In order to effectively work on a project a number of tools are essential. Firstly, if you are working as part of a team you need to collaborate and communicate. Slack is an ideal tool for this as it allows you to set up individual channels to communicate through. A decent IDE is also required, I prefer to use VS Code as this allows me to use the right tools for the job via the extensions.</p>
            <p>1.3 - Firstly, to build a website you need to decide on what the website is about. When you know this, you can put together a basic structure of content. This can be done by planning the individual pages and the mapping of the website structure, menus etc. I would use Trello to set specific tasks for each page so that you can map your progress and assign individual tasks per page. HTML & CSS can be used to build the website structure.</p>
            <p>1.4 - The main risk in my opinion is if you are working collaboratively with a team of developers and you all work on code differently. It may become difficult to reconcile the code as one if it is structured differently by each developer. Another concern is the advancement of technology. Technology is a fast moving area and technologies and frameworks that are cutting edge one minute can become obsolete.</p>
            <p>1.5 - To pick the correct and most suitable software for a project you will first need to ascertain what service or function the website needs to provide. For example, if you want dynamic web pages, intuitive, and interactive, using JavaScript you can embed animations that can improve user experience.</p>
            <p>1.6 - In terms of how my chosen technologies have assisted me. Trello was invaluable as it allowed me to plan and assess my progress. I was able to use Trello to allocate tasks to myself. VS Code was the IDE that I used, and that I will continue to use throughout my software development journey because with support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts, easy customization and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings let you navigate your code with ease.</p>
            <p>1.7 - Where  digital project involves the use of personal data then the GDPR regulations apply especially if the digital project involves things like IP addresses, mobile device ID's, browser fingerprints, RFID tags, MAC addresses, cookies, user account IDs and any other form of system -generated data which identifies a natural person. <br>

                Where a digital project involves the use of Cookies then it is important to let people/my client  know what the cookies do and why. This is covered by Regulation 6 of GDPR. Regulation 6 GDPR applies to anyone working on a digital project where information is stored on a user's device or gains access to information on a user's device. <br>
                
                Articles 13 & 14 of GDPR specifies that individuals/my clients  have the right to be informed about what is done with their data . This is important when working on a Digital Project .When working on a Digital Project which involves collecting personal data from Individuals - then I need to give my Clients the name and contact number of the organisation, I work for, contact details  of the DPO , explain the purposes of the processing, and the lawful basis for the processing. I also need to provide the individual/my client  with privacy information . Usually the privacy notification would be on my website as the Digital Content technician /developer  carrying out the digital  job/task. <br>
                
                Also the PECR (Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations  2003  sometimes apply alongside the GDPR. These Regulations address new risks to businesses and users engaged in digital projects. The PECR applies to digital companies engaged in marketing by phone, email, text or fax. The rules also apply where a digital content company uses Cookies, or similar technology on its website, or where a digital directory is being provided. <br>  
                
                GPPR and PECR  impact on the development work flow of digital projects. When working on a Digital Project, I will need to consider whether I need to encrypt the data, anonymise the Data and I would also need to put technical and security measures in place to protect my clients Data. <br> 
                
                I am also aware that my Client has the right to exercise his or her Subject Access Rights relating to Data Portability, to having their Data erased, and also to having the right to be forgotten. These are covered in the GDPR. <br>

            <p>2.1 & 2.2 - Whilst planning and building my website I utilised the VS Code IDE. At its heart, Visual Studio Code features a lightning fast source code editor, perfect for day-to-day use. Trello was also a great resource as it allowed me to plan my progress and visualise how I was getting on. I used Microsoft Paint App to edit some of the images so they fit the scheme I was looking for.</p>
            <p>2.3 - Overall, I am quite happy with the website. It looks aesthetically good and makes good use of colours and contras to give a modern feel to the site. In relation to changes, I would like to add more functionality to the website using Javascript.</p>
            <p>2.4 - The website should showcase our abilities to develop and build using HTML & CSS. I think that the website displays this. It also shows advanced uses of html such as downloading documents.</p>
            <p>3.1 - The tools used to build the website were effective in helping me plan and develop. This task could have been undertaken by a team, I feel that the brainstorm of ideas would help in achieving the end productusing various different opinions and mindsets.</p>
            <div>
                <p>3.2 -
                    <ul>
                        <li>Track your time: Use an app like <a href="https://tomato-timer.com/">Pomodoro timer</a> to see exactly what youâ€™re spending your time on every day.</li>
                        <li>Eat healthy foods throughout the day to avoid energy crashes and keep your brain properly fueled.</li>
                        <li>Put your phone on silent</li>
                      </ul>
            </div>
            <p>3.3 - If working as part of a team the use of Slack would help collaboration between team members. Slack allows you to communicate via a channel and also share documents. It can also be linked to Trello.</p>
            <p>3.4 - Testing is an important step in the development process. To test each part, frequently refreshing my HTML page to see the visual updates to my website.</p>
