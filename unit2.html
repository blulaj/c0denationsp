            <p>1.1 - I used a simple structure for all my pages. Each page will have a central image, a coloured navigation bar. Then each page will have a footer.</p>
            <p>1.5 - I have ensured that all content and code included on my website is my own. Certain elements, such as the Navigation bar, are taken from the Internet browsing about navigation bar templates.</p>
            <p>1.6 - Accessibility for people with disabilities is something which should be considered. One of the things that can be found throughout web content is high energy, flashing images with lots of colors and sometimes, sounds. While these moving images can be used to create engaging and visually appealing content, they can also have negative effects. The flash motions used on websites can actually cause people to become physically ill. Vomiting, dizziness and even migraines can develop from browsing the web. The flickering content and changing colors can even cause a seizureâ€”a mental surge of energy that the brain cannot keep pace with. <br> 
                Those who are prone to fits or have epilepsy should avoid high motion and brightly lit websites. If the content has to be posted with flashing images, changing colors or blaring sounds, web designers should make sure to put a warning before the content is posted so that users can decide whether they want to risk viewing the content or not.</p>
            <p>1.7 - I have used a number of file types in my website. I used an JPEG & PNG images. I chose this image format because takes up very little storage space, and is quick to upload or download.</p>
